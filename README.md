## ScratchScript - Scratch but cool

This will be a kind of game engine I guess, using concepts stolen from Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu) combined with a scriptable language. There will also be the option to convert usuage Scratch projects to ScratchScript ones.

# The Goal

... of this is to make it easy for beginners in the broad field of programming, but especially in games programming, to create what they have in mind. Like Scratch it will use a simple block-like syntax, but in a custom script language instead of using blocks.

# Features

 - Project Creation
 - Assets Management (Sounds, Scripts, Sprites, etc.)
 - Scratch to ScratchScript converter
 - and some more if I have the time to work on it more

# Language syntax (WIP)

...
